# 🐦 X-Clone (Twitter Clone)

A fully functional clone of **X (formerly Twitter)**, built with modern web technologies. This project replicates the core UI and interactions of Twitter, with additional enhancements like a real-time AI chatbot to provide an interactive, intelligent assistant experience.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ Clean and responsive UI using **Tailwind CSS**
- 💬 **AI Chatbot** integrated to interact with users intelligently

## 🤖 AI Chatbot

The AI chatbot is a key highlight of this clone. Built using JavaScript, it understands user queries and intelligently responds, redirecting users to relevant content on the site or simulating conversation, just like on the real X platform.
